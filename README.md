# IntegerSignal
A header-only C++ library for efficient integer-only signal processing and response curves, defined using templates for fast and flexible mathematical operations.

## Features
- Integer-only Arithmetic: No floating point operations, ensuring efficiency and suitability for systems where floating-point math is not available.

- Templates and Inheritance: Provides flexibility and ease of use, allowing for custom filter and response curve implementations.

- Common Filters: Includes implementations of various filters like EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and DEMA (Double Exponential Moving Average).

- Response Curves: Includes implementations for common mathematical curves like power and fast square root.
